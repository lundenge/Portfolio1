    title: "Smart Music",
    description: `Description: A web application designed to provide a platform for local singers and cineastes to sell their songs and movies. The project aims to empower talented individuals, particularly those in the Dzaleka Refugee Camp, by offering them a means to monetize their creative works and potentially reduce poverty within the community.
                   As the developer, I was responsible for the full-stack development of the application. This included designing the user interface, implementing the backend architecture, and integrating a secure payment gateway to facilitate transactions.
                   The primary goal of the Video Gallery project is to provide a marketplace for local artists to showcase and sell their content. By offering a secure and accessible platform, the application helps artists reach a broader audience, generate income, and gain financial independence. This initiative is especially significant in the Dzaleka Refugee Camp, where many talented individuals lack opportunities to commercialize their work. By enabling artists to sell their songs and movies, the app contributes to economic empowerment and community development.`,
